        <h2 class="my-8">What's Role-playing?</h2>
        <p>
          Like a board game, a role-playing game is played by sitting around a
          table with your friends. <br />But, as a role-playing game, A Thousand
          Faces of Adventure is a little different. It's asymmetrical.
          <br /><br />One friend plays the "GM" role and is playing with
          different rules from the others The action takes place in a shared,
          imagined world. It's like collaborative group storytelling Like a
          "legacy" board game, the state of the game changes by playing it.
          <br /><br />Players change their characters from one session to the
          next, and the entire fantasy world changes too The story and
          challenges are improvised! A Thousand Faces of Adventure lays out a
          series of milestones and prompts, but you need to play to find out the
          details of what happens
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">Is this just like Dungeons &amp; Dragons?</h2>
        <p>
          Well... <i>a little bit</i>.
          <br />
          Like D&amp;D (and many other role-playing games), the story of the
          game takes place in a shared, imagined universe limited only by
          the imaginations of the players.
          There will also be fantasy combat involving swords and magic.
          <br />
          A Thousand Faces of Adventure is built for creating stories that
          have, at their core, a structure called "The Hero's Journey".
          Specific rules cause the characters in the story to
          cross a threshold into a mysterious, unknown world, where they find
          a special prize, and then they return to their home as agents of
          meaningful change.
          <br />
          There are no "adventure modules" or pre-set story though - the
          challenge for the GM is the challenge of playing jazz: improvising
          and letting wondrous story details emerge naturally, all the
          while earning points by keeping to the structure.
          <br />
          Another difference is the physical format. A Thousand Faces of
          Adventure is played with tokens and cards, with all the necessary
          information right there on the tabletop, and not encoded on pages
          in a thick book.
          <br />
          For the players, the challenge is not miniatures-based grid combat,
          but rather deck-building and managing the economy of XP tokens and
          mitigating risk by smart uses of "move" cards.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">How long does it take to play?</h2>
        <p>
          There are 3 formats included, a 3-hour (aka "One Shot"), a 9-hour,
          and a 30-hour campaign.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>
          The retail cost has yet to be determined. Today, the "playtest"
          version is available for free. Follow @boardcrafting on Twitter
          or join discussions on the <code>/r/RPGdesign</code> subreddit
          to get updates about the availability of a retail product.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">How many players are needed?</h2>
        <p>
          The game plays best with between 3 and 5 players. One of those
          players will be the GM, and the rest will play the adventurers
          of the story.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">What do I need to play?</h2>
        <p>
          The playtest kit available on the Downloads page includes
          everything you will need to print-and-play at home. Additionally,
          there is a digital version of the Deckahedron (a deck of 20 cards
          players need to generate random results) at 
          <a href="https://www.1kfa.com/table">Togetherness Table</a>
          <br />
          (This tool has many other uses, the Deckahedron is found by clicking
          the "Cards" button)
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">Is there an online version?</h2>
        <p>
          A Thousand Faces of Adventure is 100% designed to be played with
          other human beings, ideally in person, but failing that, it can be
          played with video-conferencing tools and the above-mentioned
          <a href="https://www.1kfa.com/table">Togetherness Table</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="my-8">Is the GM playing *against* the other players?</h2>
        <p>
          The GM should
          <a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/161727/what-does-be-a-fan-of-the-characters-mean">be a fan of the characters</a>.
          But the GM is not a "god" of the shared, imagined universe of the
          game. The GM cannot just "do anything". In A Thousand Faces of
          Adventure, the GM is another player following rules, but their
          rules are different from the others.
          <br />
          During play, GMs collect points, "Journey Points" and "Shadow Points".
          With Shadow Points, a GM can increase the difficulty of the challenges
          the other players face. With Journey Points, the GM can "break" or
          "bend" certain other rules of the game, even perform "miracles", like
          bringing dead characters back to life.
